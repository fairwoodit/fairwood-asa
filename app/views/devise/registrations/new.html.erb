      <p>
        Signup/Enrollment opens on December 14, 2015.
        Enrollments will remain open until December 25.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kindergartners will be picked up by vendors in the
        classroom.
        Other grades are expected to go from their classroom to the area where the
        activity
        is held after school ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        The exact location of each activity will be communicated to parents
        after the closure of signups (or Wednesday 12/16).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each activity has a maximum number of students set by the instructor.
        <strong>Enrollments are first come, first served.
        </strong> We will open an activity waiting list
        when the maximum number is reached. We will inform parents as soon as possible to
        confirm additional classes if possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        An activity might be cancelled (or postponed to the next semester) if we donâ€™t
        reach
        a minimum of students per class. We might be able to confirm the class at higher
        cost.
        <strong>If an activity is canceled, parents will be refunded. ASA Team will
          communicate details regarding this as needed.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>After the class starts, no refund will be possible for any
          reason.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Aftering enrolling in an activity online, please print the
        automatic confirmation email you have received and bring it to the Fairwood School
        office with your payment (cash or
        check)
        within 48 hours. Your enrollment is pending until payment is made.
        <strong>After 48 hours,
          if no payment was received, the signup will be cancelled and your spot
          released.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Free spots are intended for low-revenue families and are limited to 1 child, per
        family, per activity. Each request is pending until the eligibility is approved by
        school administration. Free spots will be confirmed a few days before the activity
        starting date and only when the minimum of signups is reached.
